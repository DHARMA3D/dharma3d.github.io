<p>Prof. Krupali Uplekar Krusche teaches architectural design and historic preservation at the School of Architecture, University of Notre Dame. In 2007, Prof. Krusche started the DHARMA (Digital Historic Architectural Research and Material Analysis) research lab, specializing in 3D documentation of World Heritage Sites. In 2008, the team started its first major project by documenting four renaissance age major tomb monuments in India, one of them being Taj Mahal. In January 2012, they conducted their second phase of the project, including 3D scanning of Akbar's and Itmud-ud-daulah's tomb in partnership with the Archeological Survey of India. The proposal is extended to start a Yamuna River front study for this area in the next four years. In 2010, she and her team documented the world renowned Roman Forum, Rome, Italy in partnership with the Soprintendenza Speciale per i Beni Archeologici di Roma, Ministry of Heritage and Culture, Rome. A 3D exhibit is being planned as a result of this project in 2014 at the forum site. Both projects are being planned under the MoU with the World Heritage Center of UNESCO.</p>
<p>Prof. Krusche co-authored a book with Vinayak Bharne titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rediscovering-Hindu-Temple-Architecture-Urbanism/dp/1443841374/ref=sr_1_15?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349721438&amp;sr=1-15&amp;keywords=hindu+temple" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Rediscovering the Hindu Temple</i></a>, Cambridge Scholars Press, Nov 2012.</p>

It was at PSNC where he got interested in building science gateways and distributed computing middleware tools. During his tenure at PSNC Nabrzyski has built a team that developed and supported the GridSphere portlet framework, and later the VineToolkit framework. Both were used in many collaborations worldwide. While in Europe Nabrzyski was involved in more than twenty EC funded projects, including GridLab, CrossGrid, CoreGrid, GridCoord, QoSCoSGrid, Inteligrid and ACGT. Within his last five years at Notre Dame Nabrzyski has been focused on building the Center for Research Computing. The Center, a 40+ staff and faculty research enterprise has been involved in many research projects funded nationally and internationally, including DHARMA heritage project with Prof. Krupali Uplekar.</p>
<p>Nabrzyski has received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the Poznan University of Technology in Poland. His research interests cover distributed resource management and scheduling, cloud computing, scientific portals, and decision support systems.</p>
